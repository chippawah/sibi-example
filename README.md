# Sibi Example

### Description
Full stack todo app with basic authentication.
Technologies Used:
- ***React*** - For the client side app
- ***GraphQL*** - For client <-> server data exchange
- ***MongoDB*** - For persisting data
- ***Faker*** - For dummy user creation
- ***Apollo*** - For data management on the client
- ***`graphql-yoga` & `create-react-app`*** - For easy setup
- ***Docker & Docker Compose*** - For easy deployment

### Default Users

To generate some fake user emails when the DB User table is empty I've used the [`faker`](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) npm package.

The default password is `'foo-bar'` when env variable `DEFAULT_PASS` is empty.

---
### Running The App

You'll need to install packages in both `client` and `server`.
You can use the script `yarn install_packages` for convenience or
go to each folder and run `yarn install`.

To run the app you can use either `docker-compose up` or
run a local instance of MongoDB and use the `yarn start` command.
In either case you can open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the React client.

To view the GraphQL playground go to `http://localhost:9090`

> *You need to make sure the MongoDB instance is running before the server starts.*
>
> *If you run into issues you can use `docker-compose up -d mongodb` before
running `docker-compose up`.*
